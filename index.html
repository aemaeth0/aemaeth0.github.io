		<h1>Welcome</h1>
  	<p>Heya, my name is Al Pizano and I'm a Computer Engineer from the greater Chicago area! I'll be graduating from Purdue University with a BS of Computer Engineering in 2019 and would like to present
			my portfolio, resume, contact and other information on this website! I really enjoy programming in every aspect (from Java to C++) to front-end and back-end, and
			 I'm always trying to learn new programming languages and keep up daily with new technologies!
			Majoring in Computer Engineering also made me well-versed in the electrical/hardware aspects of engineering aswell, so I much enjoy circuit analysis and programming on FPGAs using Altera Quartus!
			Thanks for checking out my website once again!</p>
			<p>This website is of course being coded in HTML and CSS from scratch, and I will be programming dynamic features with JavaScript and blog/news posting system using PHP and MySQL</p>
